# T4-Weekly

### Steps to be followed:
- Fork the Repository.
- Go to your destined branch.
- Create a folder named as `WeekYY`.
- Once you have finished coding, you can upload the files to your branch.
- Create a Pull Request from your Repository to the `T4-weekly` repository's branch which has your own name. Make sure the branch names are correct.
- Every week from the `master` branch of your own repository click on `Fetch Upstream` to get the questions to your own repository. 

### Folder structure:
```
├── Week01
│   ├── <qn_name>
│   ├── <qn_name>
│   │── <qn_name>
│	...
│
├── Week02
│   ├── <qn_name>
│   ├── <qn_name>
│   │── <qn_name>
│	...
│
├── Week03
│   ├── <qn_name>
│   ├── <qn_name>
│   │── <qn_name>
│	...
...
```

### Creating a folder:
Github doesn't allow us to create en empty folder. So make sure while creating a folder, you have at least 1 file in it. To create a folder, click on `Add file` option and in the next page enter the folder name followed by a `/` and then your question name. If you still have any doubts about folder creation, checkout this [Stack Overflow](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/12258399/how-do-i-create-a-folder-in-a-github-repository) post!

### Happy Coding!!!
